# Phase 1.5 — Polish Backlog

Deferred items from the Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 Layer 2 reviews (Cyra, Sentry, Testa, Perry, Scribe). Nothing in this list is a production blocker; everything is a polish / hardening item that John triaged as "defer to Phase 1.5" during the Phase 3 final fix pass. Items are organized by phase of origin and by review dimension so the reviewer for Phase 1.5 can group them into a single coherent pass.

Ordering inside each dimension is rough priority within that dimension, not a strict sequence.

## Phase 1 deferred

### Security (Sentry)

1. **RESOLVED** — commit 2e5e3f9 (Phase A: sanitize_acf_value in ApplyTemplate) **ApplyTemplate ACF unsanitized writes.** The Phase 1 `apply_template` MCP tool writes caller-supplied ACF field values directly via `update_field()` without sanitization. Same class of issue as Phase 3's BulkGenerate meta-key allowlist but on a different code path. Should also run through the same `_`-prefixed reject + optional `allowed_fields` allowlist.

### Correctness (Cyra)

2. **RESOLVED** — commit 2e5e3f9 (Phase A: EncoderException) **Encoder silent failure on `wp_json_encode`.** The Phase 1 Encoder swallows `wp_json_encode()` returning `false` and emits `{}` or `[]`. Should raise an explicit `EncoderException` with the full `JSON_ERROR_*` code instead, and callers should surface it as a WP_Error. Silent `{}` writes corrupt `_elementor_data` with no signal.

### Tests (Testa)

3. **Round-trip fixture coverage on the legacy `section`/`column` path.** Phase 1 ships round-trip tests for container-only v0.4 exports, but the Emitter also has a legacy fallback for `section`/`column` elType trees. No tests cover that path.
4. **ACF field group Free-mode tests.** The ACF Free vs Pro branching logic in the field group registrar is tested only on the Pro path. Free-mode tests are missing.

### Docs (Scribe)

5. **`uninstall.php` coverage table.** The uninstall script should have a table in `docs/runbooks/uninstall.md` listing every option, table, capability, and scheduled event the plugin writes, so the review pass can verify the uninstall path by diff instead of by inspection.

## Phase 2 deferred

### Correctness (Cyra)

6. **RESOLVED** — commit b66a4e7 (Phase B: HeaderBuilder + HeaderPresets replace duplicated logic) **Header hierarchy unification.** The `service_business` and `ecommerce` header variants have duplicated logic for nav / logo / cart icon placement. Should be refactored into a `HeaderBase` composition so a new variant (e.g. `saas`) can be added without duplicating nav wiring.

### Tests (Testa)

7. **Eight substring-match weak tests.** Eight Phase 2 integration tests assert behavior via `assertStringContainsString('class="shop-grid"', $html)`-style checks. These pass when unrelated HTML happens to contain the substring. Should be rewritten to query the DOM via `DOMDocument` + XPath for the specific expected structure.

### Security (Sentry)

8. **Fibosearch options write path — nonce audit.** The Phase 2 Fibosearch config writer is called from the onboarding wizard (correctly nonce-guarded) but also from the `configure_woocommerce` MCP tool (capability-gated, not nonce-gated — which is correct for MCP but worth documenting). Docs should explicitly note the two entry points and their respective gates.

### Docs (Scribe)

9. **`docs/runbooks/configure-woocommerce.md`** — runbook for re-running the WooCommerce configuration against an existing site (rollback, partial install recovery, how to verify).

## Phase 3 deferred

### Security (Sentry)

10. **Sentry Phase 3 #3 — table name `%i` migration.** Smart Slider 3 table names are currently concatenated directly into prepared SQL via `"{$this->sliders_table}"` with a `phpcs:ignore`. WordPress 6.2+ supports `%i` as an identifier placeholder in `$wpdb->prepare()`. Should migrate to `%i` where supported and drop the ignore.
11. **Sentry Phase 3 #4 — MyISAM transaction engine check.** The Smart Slider + BulkGenerate transaction code calls `$wpdb->query('START TRANSACTION')` without checking the storage engine. On MyISAM, the START is silently ignored and the COMMIT is a no-op — partial state can persist and the code will return a success that isn't. Should probe `information_schema.TABLES` once on activation and store the engine per table in a plugin option; gate the transaction wrapping on InnoDB.
12. **Sentry Phase 3 #5 — `get_progress` capability check.** `BulkGenerate::get_progress()` reads a transient without calling `current_user_can()`. Progress data is not sensitive, but the entry point should still be gated on the same capability as the tool that wrote the transient.
13. **Sentry Phase 3 #6 — version regex tightening.** `SliderRepository::detect_version()` uses `preg_match('/^([\d.]+)/', ...)` which accepts `..` and `...` as version prefixes. Should tighten to `/^(\d+\.\d+\.\d+(?:\.\d+)?)/` for Smart Slider's `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.BUILD` convention.
14. **Sentry Phase 3 #7 — `last_error` leak.** `SmartSliderUnavailable` exception messages include `$wpdb->last_error` verbatim. In a verbose MySQL error, this can include the raw query. Should be scrubbed to a stable error code before surfacing, with the full `last_error` logged to the PHP error log instead.

### Correctness (Cyra)

15. **`SmartSliderUnavailable` exception split.** The single exception type is used for "plugin missing", "version out of range", "capability missing", and "DB write failed". These are four different categories of caller concern. Should be split into `SmartSliderNotInstalled`, `SmartSliderVersionOutOfRange`, `SmartSliderAccessDenied`, `SmartSliderWriteFailed`.
16. **Cyra Phase 3 #5 — BulkGenerate nested-transaction detection.** `BulkGenerate::execute()` calls `START TRANSACTION` unconditionally when `transactional: true`. If the caller is already inside a transaction (e.g. a WP-CLI command that wrapped its own), we issue a nested START which many storage engines silently downgrade to a savepoint. Should probe `@@in_transaction` or track the state via a plugin-owned flag.
17. **RESOLVED** — commit 2e5e3f9 (Phase A: ManageSlider ID validation) **ManageSlider `slider_id=0` rejection.** The `ManageSlider` MCP tool's `int()` helper coerces missing / invalid `slider_id` to `0`. A downstream `$wpdb->delete($table, ['id' => 0])` then does nothing and returns `0 rows affected`, which the caller sees as a successful delete of "nothing". Should explicitly reject `slider_id <= 0` with a `WP_Error`.
18. **Smart Slider 3 Pro (`N2SSPRO`) discriminator.** The `SliderRepository` gates on Smart Slider 3 Free only; when Pro is active, the constant and table names differ. Should either explicitly refuse Pro with a clear error or add a Pro discriminator path.

### Tests (Testa)

19. **LayoutJudge rule-combination coverage.** Each of the 6 rules has a happy-path test. There are no tests for situations where two rules both match with close confidence scores — the tie-breaking behavior is untested.
20. **SliderRepository integration tests on a real wp-env DB.** Unit tests cover every SliderRepository method against the `wpdb` stub. Integration tests against a real MySQL instance inside wp-env are not yet written; the schema assumptions (column types, JSON encoding compatibility with the Smart Slider front-end) are only verified by source inspection, not by round-trip.

### Performance (Perry)

21. **Perry Phase 3 #X — `JudgedEmitter` rule evaluation caching.** `LayoutJudge::decide()` re-runs every rule on every section evaluation. For the bulk page generator's 50-item run, that's 300 rule evaluations. Should memoize `SectionData` hash → decision.

### Docs (Scribe)

22. **`docs/runbooks/smart-slider-3-crud.md`** — runbook for the Smart Slider 3 CRUD layer: version compatibility matrix, cache invalidation behavior, how to recover a corrupted slider, how to roll back a mid-sequence delete failure.
23. **`docs/runbooks/bulk-generate-pages.md`** — runbook for the `bulk_generate_pages` MCP tool: matrix mode recipes, progress polling, rollback on failure, how to re-run after a partial run.

## Cross-phase infrastructure deferred

24. **PHPStan 2.x upgrade.** PHPStan 2.0 adds level 10, list types, `@phpstan-pure` enforcement, and uses 50-70% less memory. Package is pinned to `^1.11` and upgrade requires a config migration. Hux has been ignoring the "Tell the user PHPStan 2.x is available" nag message on every run since Phase 2; noise instances 1-7 acknowledged across the three phases.
25. **CI matrix — PHP 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 × WP 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8 × Elementor 3.20, 3.25, 3.30.** Currently only PHP 8.4 + WP 6.5 + Elementor 3.20 is exercised locally. Full matrix should land in Phase 1.5 via GitHub Actions.
26. **Strauss or php-scoper dependency prefixing.** `wordpress/mcp-adapter` ships under its own namespace, which is fine today but will conflict with any other plugin that ships the same dep once Forge hits 1000+ installs. Should be prefixed via Strauss before first public release.

## Emitter gaps surfaced by Pix — 2026-04-09 (Harbor Bay landing page restyle)

27. **RESOLVED** — commit 2e5e3f9 (Phase A: column_width() helper with width dimension objects) **Container width — `_inline_size` integer does not render.** Writing `'_inline_size' => 23` on a child container has no effect in modern Flexbox Container mode — Elementor ignores the value and leaves `flex-basis: auto`, so children stack full-width instead of forming a row. The working control is the `width` dimension with a unit object: `'width' => ['unit' => '%', 'size' => 23]`. Pix worked around this by writing `width` + `width_tablet` + `width_mobile` directly on every child container (trust badges, service cards, process steps, footer columns, hero split). Forge's emitter for `card_grid`, `row`, and `hero_split` primitives should emit the `width` control instead of `_inline_size`, with responsive breakpoints built in. Desired output JSON per column:
    ```json
    {
      "elType": "container",
      "settings": {
        "width": { "unit": "%", "size": 23 },
        "width_tablet": { "unit": "%", "size": 48 },
        "width_mobile": { "unit": "%", "size": 100 },
        "content_width": "full"
      }
    }
    ```
    Without this fix, any multi-column layout emitted by Forge will render as a vertical stack on the frontend even though the Elementor editor may show it correctly. Hux should also add a CI smoke test that renders a `card_grid` to a real wp-env frontend and asserts column widths via Playwright, not just JSON shape.

28. **RESOLVED** — commit 2e5e3f9 (Phase A: background_background=classic + Kit primary color) **Hero emitter has no background default.** The `hero` block emits with `background_background: undefined`, which leaves the hero transparent on top of the page background (usually white). Pix had to add a gradient `background_background: 'gradient'` + two color stops + angle directly in the JSON. Forge should either (a) ship a default dark-navy gradient on the `hero` block, (b) require a `background` prop at schema validation time, or (c) provide a `hero_variant` enum (`dark-gradient`, `hero-image`, `split-dark`) that sets the background + text colors in one switch. The current "silent transparent" default produces unreadable hero sections every time.

29. **RESOLVED** — commit b66a4e7 (Phase B: 5 header presets + 4 footer presets with real content) **Installer Header/Footer templates ship empty shells.** The `create_page` + `Installer` flow leaves post 9 (Header) and post 10 (Footer) with empty `_elementor_data` arrays, so visiting any front-end page before a designer fills them in shows a blank theme header/footer on top of the Elementor content. Forge should ship default Header/Footer templates with at least a minimal layout (logo + nav + CTA for header; 3-col footer + copyright for footer) using the Kit Global colors. A designer can then restyle, but the page is never visually broken out of the box.

30. **RESOLVED** — commit 2e5e3f9 (Phase A: CacheClearer utility) **Theme Builder conditions cache does not auto-regenerate after JSON writes.** After writing `_elementor_data` to a post that has active conditions (`include/general`), the theme builder conditions cache stays stale and the new content isn't rendered on the frontend until `\Elementor\Plugin::$instance->files_manager->clear_cache()` and `delete_option('elementor_pro_theme_builder_conditions_cache')` are called explicitly. Forge's write path (`create_page`, `apply_template`, `update_elementor_data`, etc.) should always clear both caches as the last step of the write, before returning success. Right now the caller has to remember — Pix had to add this to her tmp script manually, and the first render was using John's earlier version of the page.

31. **RESOLVED** — commit 2e5e3f9 (Phase A: set in CreatePage) **`_wp_page_template` is not part of the `create_page` schema.** When using `apply_template` or `create_page`, the page template (`_wp_page_template`) is left at the theme default, which renders the Elementor content inside the theme's header/footer. That's usually what you want. But when a page is created as the landing page and needs to render with a full-width layout including Theme Builder header/footer (not theme chrome), the caller has to manually `update_post_meta($post_id, '_wp_page_template', 'elementor_header_footer')` after the fact. Forge should expose `page_template: 'default' | 'elementor_canvas' | 'elementor_header_footer'` as a first-class prop on `create_page` and set both `_wp_page_template` and `_elementor_template` in one step.

32. **RESOLVED** — commit b66a4e7 (Phase B: set_kit_globals MCP tool + KitWriter) **No built-in Kit Global palette + typography writer.** Pix had to update `_elementor_page_settings` on post 6 (Default Kit) manually to load the Harbor Bay brand palette into `system_colors`, `custom_colors`, `system_typography`, `h1_typography_*`, `button_*`, etc. This is 80+ lines of hand-written settings just to get the four brand colors into Kit Globals. Forge should ship a `set_kit_globals` MCP tool that accepts a `BrandPalette` struct (primary, secondary, text, accent, + font families + heading sizes + button style) and emits the correct `_elementor_page_settings` update. Every new client site needs this as step 1 — it should not require 80 lines of PHP.

33. **`text-editor` widget is being abused to emit raw inline-styled HTML because icon-box, divider, and form widgets don't cover all cases.** Pix emitted every trust badge, footer contact list, footer service list, hero form card form, and copyright line as a `text-editor` widget with a raw HTML string. This works but kills accessibility (no proper heading hierarchy, no form labels associated via `<label for>`, inline styles that bypass the Kit Globals cascade, no hover states). Forge should add dedicated emitters for:
    - `trust_badge_strip` — 4-column row of icon + text, rendered as `icon-box` widgets so they inherit Kit Global colors and Lighthouse sees real `<ul>`/`<li>` structure
    - `contact_list` — phone/email/hours as a proper semantic list with icon widgets
    - `footer_link_column` — heading + `<ul>` of links, not a text-editor with inline anchors
    - `hero_form_card` — a container with a CF7 or Forms widget embedded, not a text-editor HTML mockup
    Designers should never need to write inline-styled HTML for primitives that exist in every service business landing page.

34. **Contrast validation is not part of Forge's write path.** Pix discovered post-render that white text on orange `#F19D3B` is 2.18:1 contrast (fails WCAG AA) even though that's the default CTA pairing in the Melbourne Painting Specialty reference and Forge's `service_business_kit`. Every page Forge emits with the default orange button + white text ships broken for accessibility. Forge should:
    - Add a `validate_kit` step that runs `BrandPalette` pairings through a contrast check at write time
    - Refuse to commit a Kit Global with a button pairing below 4.5:1 (body) or 3.0:1 (large, 18pt+ bold)
    - Suggest the nearest-hue darker color when a validation fails (e.g., "Orange #F19D3B white text fails, use `#1A2940` navy text (6.71:1) or darken orange to `#B85F00` (4.49:1)")
    This is a correctness gap (Cyra domain) more than an accessibility polish item — it's shipping broken defaults.

## Emitter gaps surfaced by Pix — 2026-04-10 (QA Building Supplies EPS Cladding service page)

35. **RESOLVED** — commit 2e5e3f9 (Phase A: column_width() with gap calculation) **Percentage-width columns must account for flex gap.** When Forge's `card_grid` or `row` primitive emits 3 columns with `width: 33.33%` and a 24px flex gap, the children overflow the container and wrap to 2 columns. The caller has to compute `(100% - (n-1)*gap) / n` by hand for every column count and gap size, then hard-code the result. On a 1200px container with 24px gap, desktop 3-col should be `32%` not `33.33%`; tablet 2-col should be `47%` not `48%`. Forge should accept `columns: 3` + `gap: 24` and compute the width for the caller, OR emit `flex: 1 1 0` with the gap applied via CSS gap property (modern flexbox pattern), so the math is not the designer's problem. Without this fix, every multi-column layout the designer ships has a one-shot layout bug that only surfaces after the screenshot pass.

36. **`files_manager->clear_cache()` does not delete per-post CSS files when the content hash is unchanged.** When re-running a generator script that tweaks existing element settings without changing their IDs, Elementor's `clear_cache()` call skips regenerating `post-<id>.css` because the file timestamp is newer than the save event. The designer ends up debugging a stale layout that matches their previous JSON, not the current one. Workaround: `@unlink(wp_upload_dir()['basedir'] . '/elementor/css/post-<id>.css')` after `clear_cache()`. Forge's `update_elementor_data` write path should unconditionally delete the per-post CSS file before returning success, OR bump the post's `_elementor_css` meta key to force a re-hash. This is the second cache-staleness bug surfaced in two pages — the pattern is clear: clear_cache() is insufficient.

37. **`_elementor_data` MUST be `wp_slash(wp_json_encode(...))`, not a raw array.** Passing an array directly to `update_post_meta` for `_elementor_data` results in WordPress serializing it via `maybe_serialize()` into a PHP serialized string, which Elementor does NOT recognize on read — the post_meta round-trip silently corrupts the data and the page renders blank. The correct call is `update_post_meta($post_id, '_elementor_data', wp_slash(wp_json_encode($data)))` — JSON-encoded THEN slashed, because `update_post_meta` will call `wp_unslash` on the way in. This invariant is not documented anywhere in the Forge README and no test catches a blank render. Forge's Encoder should be the only code path allowed to write `_elementor_data`, and it should assert the string form before calling `update_post_meta`. Ideally, ship a public `ElementorForge\Emitter\Encoder::write_document($post_id, array $data)` helper that does the slash/encode dance so external callers (one-off scripts, future integrations) don't have to rediscover this invariant every time.

38. **No schema or helper for a reusable service-page content doc.** Pix shipped a `service-page-schema.md` to Owner's Inbox that describes a minimum service-page content shape (hero, sub_hero, sections[]: prose_bullets/prose_block/feature_grid/applications/cta_band) with character-count constraints per field. Forge has no equivalent content-doc format, so every new service page is 500+ lines of hand-written PHP. Forge should ship:
    - A `ServicePageContent` DTO with the schema encoded as PHPstan types
    - A `service_page` composite block that consumes the DTO and emits the 7-section layout
    - CLI command `wp forge service-page create --content=path/to/doc.json` that runs the generator
    - A template repo with 5 filled example docs for common construction/trade services
    The reference implementation lives at `bin/service-pages/eps-polystyrene-cladding.php` — copy the `$content` shape and the helper function signatures.

39. **Per-page Kit overrides are the right seam for multi-client sites, but undocumented.** When a wp-env has one client site (Harbor Bay) and you need to add a second client (QA Building Supplies), writing their palette into the Default Kit (post 6) clobbers the first client. Pix worked around this by writing a per-page `_elementor_page_settings` meta with `system_colors` for the new brand, which Elementor correctly scopes to that page's `.elementor-<id>` selector. This is the right pattern for multi-client wp-env setups but is not documented in Forge or in the Elementor README, so the first-time designer defaults to writing Default Kit and blows up the first client. Forge should:
    - Document the per-page kit override pattern as the first-class answer for multi-client dev environments
    - Add a `set_page_kit_override` MCP tool that accepts a `BrandPalette` and writes the per-page settings
    - Add a guard to `set_kit_globals` (gap #32) that refuses to write the Default Kit when more than one published page exists under a different brand
    Prevents a second client from accidentally clobbering an existing brand.
